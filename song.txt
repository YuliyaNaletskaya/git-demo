All together now
Live is life
Live is life
Live is life
When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute of an hour
Don't think about a rest
Then you all get the power
You all get the best
When everyone gives everything
And every song everybody sings
Then it's life
Live is life
Live is life
Live
Live is life, when we all feel the power
Live is life, come on stand up and dance
Live is life, when the feeling of the people
Live is life, is the feeling of the band, yeah
